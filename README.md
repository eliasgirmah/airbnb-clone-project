# Airbnb Clone Project

## üìÑ Project Overview
This project is a backend clone of Airbnb, designed to manage user registrations, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. It aims to mimic the core features of the Airbnb platform with a focus on building scalable and maintainable backend services.

## üéØ Project Goals
- User management (registration, authentication, profiles)
- Property listing management (create, update, delete properties)
- Booking system for users to reserve properties
- Payment processing for booking transactions
- Review system for users to review properties
- Optimize database performance with indexing and caching

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Django
- **API Framework:** Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Query Language:** GraphQL (optional for flexible queries)
- **Task Queue:** Celery
- **Cache:** Redis
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (or other pipelines)

## üë• Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**  
  Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic, designing API endpoints, integrating third-party services, and ensuring the application is scalable and efficient.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**  
  Designs, implements, and maintains the database schema. Handles indexing, optimization, backup strategies, and ensures data integrity and security.

- **DevOps Engineer**  
  Manages the deployment process, monitors server performance, sets up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and ensures system scalability and reliability.

- **QA Engineer**  
  Ensures that all backend functionalities meet the project's requirements through thorough testing. Writes automated tests, performs manual testing, and reports bugs.

- **Project Manager (optional addition)**  
  Coordinates between different roles, ensures timelines are met, manages communication, and tracks project progress.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

### Key Entities:

#### 1. Users
- **id**: Primary Key
- **username**: Unique username
- **email**: Unique email address
- **password**: Hashed password
- **date_joined**: Timestamp of registration
- **role**: (e.g., Host, Guest)

#### 2. Properties
- **id**: Primary Key
- **owner_id**: Foreign Key to Users (Host)
- **title**: Property title
- **description**: Property description
- **location**: Property address or coordinates
- **price_per_night**: Rental price per night

#### 3. Bookings
- **id**: Primary Key
- **property_id**: Foreign Key to Properties
- **user_id**: Foreign Key to Users (Guest)
- **check_in_date**: Start date of booking
- **check_out_date**: End date of booking
- **status**: (e.g., Confirmed, Cancelled)

#### 4. Payments
- **id**: Primary Key
- **booking_id**: Foreign Key to Bookings
- **amount**: Payment amount
- **payment_date**: Timestamp of payment
- **payment_status**: (e.g., Paid, Pending)

#### 5. Reviews
- **id**: Primary Key
- **property_id**: Foreign Key to Properties
- **user_id**: Foreign Key to Users (Guest)
- **rating**: Numerical rating (e.g., 1-5)
- **comment**: Text review
- **created_at**: Timestamp of review

### Relationships:
- A **User** can create multiple **Properties** (1-to-Many).
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** (1-to-Many).
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** (Guest) and one **Property** (Many-to-1).
- A **Payment** is linked to a specific **Booking** (1-to-1).
- A **Review** is created by a **User** for a **Property** (Many-to-1).

## üß© Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their profile information. It ensures that each user has a secure and personalized experience while using the platform.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. This feature is essential for offering a wide range of accommodation options for guests to choose from.

### Booking System
Provides users the ability to book available properties for specific dates. It manages reservation details, booking status, and ensures proper scheduling between hosts and guests.

### Payment Processing
Handles secure transactions related to property bookings. It ensures that payments are recorded accurately, and booking statuses are updated based on payment outcomes.

### Review System
Allows users to leave feedback on properties after their stay. Reviews help build trust within the community and assist future guests in making informed decisions.

### API Documentation
Provides a clear and standardized way for developers to understand and integrate with the backend services. OpenAPI and GraphQL documentation ensure the APIs are easy to explore and use.

### Database Optimization
Involves indexing, caching, and efficient query handling to ensure the system remains fast and scalable as the number of users, properties, and bookings grow.

## üîí API Security Overview

Ensuring the security of the Airbnb Clone backend APIs is critical to protect user data, transactions, and system integrity. The following key security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Use secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens).
  - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive endpoints based on user roles (Guest, Host, Admin).

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**
  - Validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).
  - Use serializers in Django REST Framework to enforce data types and constraints.

- **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
  - Implement rate limits to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
  - Use Django REST Framework's throttling classes or integrate external tools like API Gateway.

- **Secure Communications**
  - Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all API traffic to ensure data encryption in transit.
  - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

- **Error Handling**
  - Avoid exposing detailed error messages to clients.
  - Log errors securely for debugging without leaking sensitive information.

- **Data Protection**
  - Hash sensitive information such as passwords using strong algorithms (e.g., PBKDF2, bcrypt).
  - Store minimal sensitive data, and encrypt data at rest where necessary.

- **Monitoring and Logging**
  - Implement centralized logging to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
  - Monitor authentication attempts, payment activities, and API access patterns.
